# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This repository contains two applications for automating the transfer of tracks from Qobuz playlists to a user's favorites list:

1. **Console Application** (`QobuzPlaylistToFavorites.csproj`): Original C# console app
2. **Web Application** (`QobuzWebApp/`): Modern ASP.NET Core + React web application

Both use the QobuzApiSharp library to interact with the Qobuz music streaming service API.

## Development Commands

### Console Application
```bash
# Build and run the console app
dotnet build QobuzPlaylistToFavorites.csproj
dotnet run --project QobuzPlaylistToFavorites.csproj
```

### Web Application

**Quick Start (Recommended):**
```bash
cd QobuzWebApp/qobuz-web-frontend
npm run dev:full
# Starts both backend (5152) and frontend (5173)
```

**Alternative: Bash Script:**
```bash
./start-dev.sh
# Starts both servers with single command
```

**Manual (Two Terminals):**
```bash
# Terminal 1: Backend
cd QobuzWebApp && dotnet run
# Runs on http://localhost:5152

# Terminal 2: Frontend  
cd QobuzWebApp/qobuz-web-frontend && npm run dev
# Runs on http://localhost:5173
```

**Build Commands:**
```bash
# Backend
cd QobuzWebApp && dotnet build

# Frontend
cd QobuzWebApp/qobuz-web-frontend && npm run build
```

## Web Application Architecture

### Backend (ASP.NET Core API)

**Services:**
- `QobuzAuthService`: Session-based authentication with 2-hour expiration
- `QobuzPlaylistService`: Playlist search with user playlist prioritization and track retrieval with pagination
- `QobuzFavoritesService`: Batch import and mass delete with real-time progress tracking
- `ProgressHub`: SignalR hub for real-time progress updates

**API Endpoints:**
- `POST /api/auth/login` - Authenticate with email/password
- `GET /api/auth/validate` - Validate session
- `POST /api/auth/logout` - End session
- `GET /api/playlists/search` - Search for playlists (prioritizes user's playlists when available)
- `GET /api/playlists/{id}/tracks` - Get tracks from playlist
- `POST /api/favorites/import` - Start import process
- `GET /api/favorites/current` - Get current favorites count and list
- `DELETE /api/favorites/delete-all` - Start mass delete process
- `/hub/progress` - SignalR real-time connection

**Configuration:**
- CORS enabled for localhost:3000 and localhost:5173
- Session management with in-memory storage
- Rate limiting preserved from console app (500ms-2000ms delays)

- Mass delete favorites with strong confirmation and safety measures

### API Integration Details
- Session-based authentication with X-Session-Id headers
- Same rate limiting and retry logic as console app
- Batch processing: 50 tracks per request with 2-second delays
- Real-time progress updates via SignalR connection
- Individual track retry on batch failures
- Mass delete operations with same safety patterns as import

### Development Workflow
**Recommended**: `cd QobuzWebApp/qobuz-web-frontend && npm run dev:full`

**Manual**:
1. Start backend API: `cd QobuzWebApp && dotnet run`
2. Start frontend dev server: `cd QobuzWebApp/qobuz-web-frontend && npm run dev`
3. Access web app at http://localhost:5173
4. API available at http://localhost:5152

## Current Status & Known Issues

### âœ… Completed
- Full web application with modern UI
- All console app functionality preserved
- Real-time progress tracking (with fallback)
- Post-import completion statistics showing success rates, timing, and summary
- Responsive design for mobile/desktop
- Professional authentication flow
- Batch playlist processing with statistics
- Mass delete all favorites functionality with strong safety confirmation
- **NEW**: Filtered mass delete functionality with server-side search and optimization

### ðŸ”§ Known Issue: SignalR Connection
**Problem**: "Failed to establish real-time connection" during import
**Impact**: Import works but without real-time progress updates
**Workaround**: Fallback connection logic implemented
**Next Steps**: Debug WebSocket transport configuration

### ðŸ“‹ Quick Testing
1. Run: `cd QobuzWebApp/qobuz-web-frontend && npm run dev:full`
2. Open: http://localhost:5173
3. Login with Qobuz credentials
4. Search for playlists (try "jazz", "rock", etc.)
5. Select playlists and import to favorites
6. Test mass delete: Click "Delete All" button (red button in top-right)
7. Test filtered delete: Click "Filter & Delete" button (blue button in top-right)

## Mass Delete All Favorites Feature

### Overview
The web application now includes a mass delete feature that allows users to remove all tracks from their Qobuz favorites at once. This addresses a limitation in the Qobuz web interface which doesn't provide bulk deletion capabilities.

### Key Features
- **Preview Mode**: Shows exact count of current favorites before deletion
- **Strong Safety Confirmation**: Multiple confirmation steps with clear warnings
- **Real-time Progress**: Live updates during deletion process with cancel option
- **Batch Processing**: Same proven patterns as import (50 tracks/batch, rate limiting)
- **Error Handling**: Individual track retry on batch failures
- **Completion Statistics**: Shows success/failure rates and timing

### Usage
1. **Access**: Click red "Delete All" button in top-right corner of playlist browser
2. **Preview**: Modal shows current favorites count and loads track list
3. **Confirm**: Strong warning message with exact track count to delete
4. **Monitor**: Real-time progress tracker with option to cancel
5. **Complete**: Final statistics showing deletion results

### Safety Measures
- **Multi-step confirmation** with clear warnings about permanent deletion
- **Exact count display** so users know what they're deleting
- **Cancel option** available during deletion process
- **Rate limiting** to respect Qobuz API limits
- **Individual retry** for failed batch operations
- **No accidental triggers** - requires deliberate user action

### Technical Implementation
- **Backend**: Uses `QobuzApiService.DeleteUserFavorites()` method
- **API Endpoints**: `GET /api/favorites/current` and `DELETE /api/favorites/delete-all`
- **Frontend**: Integrated into existing PlaylistBrowser component
- **Progress Tracking**: Reuses existing ProgressTracker component
- **State Management**: Extends App component with delete operation state

## Filtered Mass Delete Feature
